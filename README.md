## Banwave.live Site Source Code!

Banwave.live is a **Roblox Banwave Detection Service** offering both a **Site & API** for developers to seamlessly integrate into their projects.

### Welcome, Developers!

We've made it incredibly easy for you to get started with development. Follow these steps to jump right in:

1.  **Clone or download** the repository from GitHub.
2.  A pre-configured Python virtual environment (`site-env`) is included with all dependencies already installedâ€”just activate it, and youâ€™re good to go!
3. If changes to any of the templates, css or js are made, make sure to run Tools/minify-code.py to minify all code **before** you push!
4. The source code for the css, js and html is **inside** of the src folder!.

**Note:** Please report any changes to the repository before pushing. Unapproved modifications can **break** critical functionality!

The start command for the backend is 
```nodemon --config server/nodemon.json```

### Technical Information

Our site is uniquely hosted on a **Nintendo Switch**, running **Ubuntu**!

The backend is built using **NodeJS**, ensuring fast and efficient performance.

The site code is a bit *iffy*
